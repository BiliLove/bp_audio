# bp_audio
**bp** stands for **bilibili ported**, but also **bai piao**.

An out-of-the-box extractor for Bilibili's official FLAC music.

It can download Bilibili-purchased music in *SQ* (aka lossless) version without an account whatsoever. While downloading, it can also acquire music's metadata, including album art. It can also download the whole *menu* (aka album) at one time.

# Example

With metadata included:

Try running this command on your own computer.

# Distribution
You can download the pre-compiled *x86_64 (amd64)* version [here](https://github.com/hanbang-wang/bp_audio/releases), which should be running without any problem on latest Windows devices. Requests for other versions will likely be ignored due to the reason in [License & Disclaimer](#license--disclaimer) section, so you will have to compile it by yourself: see [Compilation](#compilation) section below.

# Compilation
First you'll need *[Qt framework](https://www.qt.io)*; *Qt Creator* is highly suggested.

Next you'll need:

- [gumbo-query](https://github.com/lazytiger/gumbo-query) for HTML DOM parsing.

  >   Actually I can use regex, but that just makes me an idiot.

- [TagLib](https://github.com/taglib/taglib) for audio file metadata.

Then just `qmake bp_audio.pro` and `make`, as what you would do for every Qt project.

# Usage
```bash
Usage: bp_audio
Get to know some free official FLAC music.

Options:
  -a, --au <au>     Audio AU number.
  --menu            Download whole menu.
  -o, --out <path>  Output folder path.
  -?, -h, --help    Displays this help.
  -v, --version     Displays version information.
```

This is only a proof-of-concept of how bad Bilibili's inner software and web developers areâ€”the mixed use of params in `path` and `query`, the **useless** key validation of CDN, etc. Therefore, it shall only be used for research and educational purpose.
